                The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale
                period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets
                containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom,
                this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.
              </p>
              <p class="common-p">
                Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom
                wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art
                experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the
                discerning minds of crypto twitter.

                We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.
